		<h2>The Ultimate Survival Game</h2>
		<p>
			Project Zomboid is the ultimate zombie survival RPG game
			that someone can have. It is most known due to it's 
			insane realism. Whether you want to cook your frozen chicken
			at five-hundred degrees to making sure that your character is
			holding a tissue when they're feeling blue.
		</p>
		<p>
			You must learn how to survive with anything that this
			new life gives to you. You must also learn when to 
			fight and when to run. You can build your own base 
			of operations where you and your friends can plan a 
			supply run.
		</p>	
		<p>
			Surprisingly nearly ten years after its release. It
			is still an early access game and is still updated frequently 
			by the developers at The Indie Stone. A great feature in this
			game is the workshop where you can find thousands of mods that 
			can amplify your game play. Some examples are that you can add
			more weapons, locations, items, zombies, building options, and
			tons more.
		</p>
		<p>
			To learn more about the game and its price if you are interesed
			in purchasing it. I highly recommend that you check out Project 
			Zomboid's official web page.
