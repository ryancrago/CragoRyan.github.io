        <p>
            Each of these studios made a serious effort in creating the
            ideal zombie survival game that thousands of people love to play.
            I wish that I could meet each of them to thank them personally
            because this game actually increased my connection with the friends
            that I play with. One of these days if I ever get offered a job from
            The Indie Stone, I would gladly take it as I would also like to help
            improve or add to the already god-tier zombie game.
