		<h2>Why is PZ such a good game?</h2>
        <p class="left">
            Project Zomboid is such a good game because it isn't
            any normal kind of hack-n-slash zombie game. This game
            requires patience and strategy to be able to survive just
            the first day of the apocolypse.<br><br>
            You think you can survive a bite or even a scratch? Think again
            because it's 100% chance that you are infected from a bite,
            and a 5% chance of being infected from a simple scratch. So
            don't be too reckless.<br><br>
            You have several options on how you want to start in a newly
            infected Kentucky. But it is recommended for beginners to play
            the default setting, as it is the way the developers intend for
            you to play. Or you can start with their sandbox mode. Where you really
            have the power of the sun, in the palm of your hand. You want to live
            life on the dangerous side? Just set the zombie population to insane.
			<br><br>
			I don't want to spoil too much of the game. I'm trying to convince
			you to get the game because you deserve happiness.
